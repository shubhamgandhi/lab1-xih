Lab 1a
* Limitation: program have undefined behavior if sequential simple
              commands in subshells are not separated by semicolon
              manually.
      
Notes:
input is in infix format -> gets converted to postfix format -> postfix to expression tree


Lab 1b
Execute expression tree
Things to look into:
              waitpid
              fork
              execvp
              dup2
              pipe
